## My process

Após um tempo longe do Frontend, decidi fazer alguns desafios básicos para relembrar e também me divertir.
Ao longo desse processo pude perceber o que eu deveria reforçar para me tornar cada vez melhor na construção de um bom Front.

After a while away from Frontend, I decided to do some basic challenges to remember and also have fun.
During this process, I could see what I should reinforce to become even better at building a good Front.
